Building Golf Jam
=================
To build Golf Jam, you will need Godot v3.2.3. Newer versions are likely to work, but this cannot be guaranteed.

After cloning the repository, opening it in Godot will allow you to export the project to the desired target as per a standard export. No additional steps are required.
